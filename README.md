# Abstract
This project aims to analyze the trends towards songs' popularity from years to years. We want to define metrics that can lead to prediction of songs' popularity in billboard. To achive this, we use [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) that has collection of audio features and metadata of popular songs. 

Through this project, we would like to show how people tend to listen to songs, e.g. by considering the singers/artist, genres, lyrics. Then we want to use our findings to measure how newcomers in music industry become popular.

> Music is a moral law. It gives soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and charm and gaiety to life and to everything. _-Plato_

The project's main goal is to prove how society reacts to songs' quality over time. We expect to see the challenges of music industry towards time.

# Research questions
Throughout this project, we want to address the following questions:
- What is the characteristic/metrics of popular songs? What are the challenges that music industry faces? Can we analyze and predict the trend in music industry from years to years?
- Does the herding bias for hearing songs really happen in our society? Do people tend to listen to famous singers rathen than the songs themselves? Can we say that the career path for singers began by covering songs which come originally from famous artists?
- Do people care more about lyrics? Can we measure the quality and popularity of a song from its lyrics? Do the popular songs have the good quality of lyrics from literacy view points?
- Can we find plagiarisms in music industry? How often people mimick popular songs? Can we find more similliarities from popular songs compared to unpopular ones? What kind of similiarities?
